In this project, you’ll take your very first steps into the world of containers. 
You’ll create your own beginner-friendly container using Docker, then deploy it with AWS Elastic Beanstalk to make your application live on the web.

Why containers?
Containers have transformed the way developers build and share applications. They package everything an app needs into one neat bundle, making it easy to run anywhere — fast, 
consistent, and efficient. This is why containers have become the backbone of modern software deployment.

In this project, you’ll:

- Install and use Docker — your gateway to working with containers.

- Build a custom container image — package your app and its dependencies together.

- Run your container locally — test your app in a real container environment.

- Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk — and access your containerized app live on the web!
